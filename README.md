Glutton is my 378 - Mobile Computing iOS project. It's a Tinder-esque iPhone application that allows you to swipe on restaurants in your area that you like. The idea is to support the businesses by providing positive reviews on your previous visits. You win "internet points" for the amount that you participate.
